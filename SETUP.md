# How to setup a node

### Requirements

- Host computer with Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
- `Ubuntu 16.04` or `Ubuntu 18.04` (though other Linux distros are probably supported, more info coming soon).
- Docker
- Docker-Compose

### Setup

1. Install [linux-sgx-driver](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver). After a successful installation you should see `/dev/isgx` in your system.

2. Download the `docker-compose.yml` from this folder, and make sure a `config/.enigma` folder exists.

3. `docker-compose up`, which should display something like the following logs:

```

4. Open a different terminal, and launch the command-line interface (CLI) for your node:

    ```
    docker exec -it worker cli
    ```

5. Type `setup` and enter your `staking address` when prompted. Enter `ok`

6. The software will then generate an `operating address` for you, which will be displayed on the logs and on the CLI.

7. Transfer some Kovan ETH (1 KETH will be plenty) to your `operating address`

8. In the `CLI`, type `register` and look at the node status box. After a successful registration the status will change to `Registered`. In addition, you can look at the logs from the first terminal. You should eventually see a line like this:

    ```
    worker    | 2019-12-19T13:30:41Z INFO [P2P-MainController] - [REGISTER] successful registration
    ```
9. Next you need to add your stake to the Enigma contract, which takes three different transactions. The `CLI` will provide you with the destination address and the data field for each transaction, which you take to your wallet to send `0` eth to that address and include the `data` in the data field. You can use *My Ether Wallet* or *MyCrypto* to send these transactions: click on "Advanced" in the "send ether & tokens" tab to set the data field. You send these three transactions from your **Staking Address** where you hold the ENG tokens that you want to stake in running a node. Make sure that each transaction succeeds before submitting the next one.

9a. Type `generate set-address` in the `CLI`, and send a transaction (to the Enigma contract) with that data.

9b. Type `generate approve <AMOUNT>`, where `<AMOUNT>` is the amount in ENG tokens that you want to stake.

9c. Type `generate deposit <AMOUNT>`, using the same amount as in the previous step.


10. Finally, in the CLI, type `login` and wait for the node status box to change to `Running`. 
In addtion, you may look at the logs from the first terminal, You should eventually see a line like this:

    ```
    worker    | 2019-12-19T13:30:41Z INFO [P2P-MainController] - [LOGIN] successful login
    ```

ðŸ™Œ CONGRATULATIONS ðŸ™Œ your node has successfully joined the Enigma Discovery Testnet and will start being eligible to run computations in the network at the next epoch change.
